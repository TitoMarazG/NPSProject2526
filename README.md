## 💻 Repository Workflow Guide

This guide outlines the standard Git workflow for collaborating on this repository, focusing on using a Personal Access Token (PAT) for authentication (required by GitHub over HTTPS) and the essential three-step cycle: Stage, Commit, Push.

### 1. Authentication Setup (Using a Personal Access Token)

- GitHub requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of your regular password for all command-line operations (like git push) over HTTPS.

#### 🔑 A. Generate the PAT

- Go to GitHub: Navigate to Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic).

- Generate a New Token: Click Generate new token (classic).

- Define scope: You must check the repo box. This grants the token read/write access to your repositories.

- Save the Token: Once generated, IMMEDIATELY COPY the resulting string. This is the only time you will ever see it.

#### 💾 B. Use and Store the PAT

The first time you run a command that requires authentication, Git will prompt you for credentials:

- Username: Enter your GitHub username.

- Password: PASTE THE PAT (the long string) here, NOT your actual GitHub account password.

Note: *Credentials will be stored, but if they are needed, repeat the process*


### 2. Initial Setup: Cloning the Repository

Cloning downloads a copy of the repository to your local computer and sets up the necessary links to GitHub.

- Navigate: Open your terminal or Git Bash and move to the directory where you want to store the project: ```cd ~/Projects/```

- Clone: Copy the HTTPS or SSH link from the GitHub repository page and clone it: ```git clone [repository_url]```

- Enter Directory: ```cd [repository-name]```


### 3. Daily Workflow: Making and Pushing Changes

The core Git workflow is a three-step cycle that turns local file modifications into recorded history on GitHub.

#### Step 1: Check Status and Modify Files

- Download the latest changes from GitHub (*useful to use before you start*): ```git pull``` 

- Shows which files are modified (edited), untracked (new), or staged (ready to commit): ```git status```

#### Step 2: Stage and Commit (Saving the Change)

You must tell Git which changes you want to include in the next version snapshot.

##### 📁 A. Adding / Editing a File
To include new files or modified files in your commit, you must Stage them first:

- To stage a single file: ```git add my_new_file.txt```

- To stage ALL modified, new, and deleted files: ```git add```

##### ✍️ B. Committing the Snapshot
Once files are staged, you create a permanent snapshot (a commit) in your local history:

```git commit -m "Brief but descriptive summary of the changes"```

##### 🗑️ C. Deleting a File
If you want to remove a file from the repository, you must stage the deletion:

- Deletes the file locally AND stages the deletion for the next commit: ```git rm file_to_delete.txt ```

- To commit the deletion: ```git commit -m "Removed old file_to_delete.txt"```

#### Step 3: Push to Remote (Updating GitHub)
After working on the repository, you need to push (upload) all the new commits from your local directory to GitHub.

- To push to Github repository: ```git push```

Note: *If this is the first time you've pushed a new branch, you may need to use:* ```git push -u origin [branch-name]```

Note: *If your file is present locally but not on GitHub, you likely missed the git add step. Always run git status to verify your file is in the "Changes to be committed" (green) section before committing.*
